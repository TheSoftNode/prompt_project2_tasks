Prompt

Your goal is to investigate the google-deepmind/alphafold GitHub repository as of January 9, 2026 09:02 UTC to analyze how AlphaFold adapts the Transformer architecture for protein structure prediction, drawing on the papers the repository cites.

1. AlphaFold employs a recycling mechanism where the same parameters are reused across multiple iterations. Extract the architectural parameters (limited to blocks, dimensions, recycling iterations) for AlphaFold from the Nature paper and verify against the repository configuration file. Extract the equivalent architectural parameters for Transformer (big) from the Attention is All You Need paper. Using the Transformer paper’s architectural descriptions, derive a weights-only parameter-count formula for a single Transformer encoder layer, and then compute total weights for (i) the AlphaFold Evoformer by determining the total weights contributed by the Evoformer’s MSA-path computation within each block and scaling by the number of blocks specified in the configuration, and (ii) the Transformer (big) encoder stack only using the paper’s reported big-model hyperparameters and layer count. Since AlphaFold reuses parameters through recycling while Transformer does not, propose a parameter efficiency metric that accounts for effective sequential depth and calculate which architecture achieves better efficiency.

2. Compare the AlphaFold architecture to the original Transformer (big) architecture in terms of number of blocks/layers, model dimension (d_model), feedforward dimension (d_ff), and number of attention heads. Create an image of a table to compare these four architectural parameters as rows, "AlphaFold Evoformer" and "Transformer (big)" as columns, and the corresponding values in each cell. The table should have exactly 4 rows (excluding header), 3 columns (parameter name, AlphaFold Evoformer, Transformer big), and a title "Architecture Comparison: AlphaFold vs Transformer" above it.

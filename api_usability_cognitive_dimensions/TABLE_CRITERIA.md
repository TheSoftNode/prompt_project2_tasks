# Table Criteria for Question 3: Meta-Analysis Synthesis Table

This document defines the evaluation criteria for the table in Question 3.

---

## Table Requirements

**Question 3** asks for: "Create a synthesis comparison table with exactly 5 data rows (excluding header) and 4 columns. Column headers must be: 'Metric Category', 'Calculated Value', 'Unit of Measurement', 'Source Study Count'. Rows must appear in this exact order: Average Efficiency Gain, Mean Statistical Confidence, Participant Experience Range, Cognitive Load Dispersion, Meta-Study Sample Size. Include a title above the table: 'Cross-Study API Usability Meta-Analysis: Calculated Synthesis Metrics'."

---

## Structural Criteria (5 criteria: C39-C43)

### CRITERION 39 [Table Structure]
**Description:** Response contains a markdown table for Question 3.

**Weight:** Critical

**Numerical Weight:** 5

**Rationale:** Question 3 explicitly requires creating a meta-analysis synthesis table with 5 rows and 4 columns. The presence of a properly formatted markdown table is mandatory for answering this question.

**Sources:** Not applicable - structural requirement

---

### CRITERION 40 [Table Structure]
**Description:** Table has exactly 4 columns: Metric Category, Calculated Value, Unit of Measurement, Source Study Count.

**Weight:** Critical

**Numerical Weight:** 5

**Rationale:** Question 3 specifies the table must have four specific columns. A table with fewer or more columns fails to meet the specification.

**Sources:** Not applicable - structural requirement

---

### CRITERION 41 [Table Structure]
**Description:** Table has exactly 5 data rows (excluding header).

**Weight:** Critical

**Numerical Weight:** 5

**Rationale:** Question 3 specifies five metric categories. The table must have 5 data rows (plus 1 header row).

**Sources:** Not applicable - structural requirement

---

### CRITERION 42 [Table Structure]
**Description:** Table includes a title "Cross-Study API Usability Meta-Analysis: Calculated Synthesis Metrics".

**Weight:** Major

**Numerical Weight:** 4

**Rationale:** Question 3 explicitly specifies the table must include this exact title above the table.

**Sources:** Not applicable - structural requirement

---

### CRITERION 43 [Table Structure]
**Description:** Rows appear in the specified order: Average Efficiency Gain, Mean Statistical Confidence, Participant Experience Range, Cognitive Load Dispersion, Meta-Study Sample Size.

**Weight:** Major

**Numerical Weight:** 4

**Rationale:** Question 3 explicitly specifies the exact ordering of rows. This ordering is critical for evaluating whether the model followed instructions precisely.

**Sources:** Not applicable - structural requirement

---

## Content Criteria - Meta-Study Sample Size Row (5 criteria: C44-C48)

### CRITERION 44 [Table Content]
**Description:** Meta-Study Sample Size row reports the sum of all unique participants across three studies as 67.

**Weight:** Critical

**Numerical Weight:** 5

**Rationale:** Question 3 requires calculating "the sum of all unique participants across the three primary empirical studies examined". Ellis et al. (2007): 12 participants, Stylos & Clarke (2007): 30 participants, Piccioni et al. (2013): 25 participants. Total = 67.

**Sources:**
- Ellis et al. (2007): 12 participants
- Stylos & Clarke (2007): 30 participants
- Piccioni et al. (2013): 25 participants

---

### CRITERION 45 [Table Content]
**Description:** Meta-Study Sample Size row expresses the value as "N = 67" in the Calculated Value column.

**Weight:** Major

**Numerical Weight:** 4

**Rationale:** Question 3 explicitly specifies to "express it as 'N = [value]'" in the Calculated Value column.

**Sources:** Not applicable - specified in prompt

---

### CRITERION 46 [Table Content]
**Description:** Meta-Study Sample Size row reports "participants" as the unit of measurement.

**Weight:** Major

**Numerical Weight:** 4

**Rationale:** Question 3 explicitly specifies to "use 'participants' as the unit" in the Unit of Measurement column.

**Sources:** Not applicable - specified in prompt

---

### CRITERION 47 [Table Content]
**Description:** Meta-Study Sample Size row reports 3 as the source study count.

**Weight:** Major

**Numerical Weight:** 4

**Rationale:** Question 3 requires reporting "how many studies contributed to this total". Three studies contributed: Ellis et al. (2007), Stylos & Clarke (2007), and Piccioni et al. (2013).

**Sources:** Not applicable - derived from analysis

---

### CRITERION 48 [Table Content]
**Description:** Average Efficiency Gain row reports the calculated efficiency gain percentage from Question 1 (60.2%).

**Weight:** Critical

**Numerical Weight:** 5

**Rationale:** The table should synthesize calculated values from previous questions. Question 1 requires calculating the efficiency gain as percentage improvement: (817.5 - 325.5) / 817.5 × 100 = 60.2%.

**Sources:** Derived from Ellis et al. (2007) completion time data analyzed in Question 1
